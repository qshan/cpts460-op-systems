The first lab assignment was to create a booter program that would load a binary from a virtual disk into memory and boot it. We were provided a disk image, an assembly file [bs.s](start/bs.s), and a C file [bc.c](start/bc.c) to start and asked to complete the following tasks:

1. make a shell script to compile, assemble, and link the .s and .c files to an executable and then put that executable in the virtual disk

2. Write gets() and printf() in C using the provided getc()/putc() functions.

3. Print out partition information stored in the Master Boot Recor (MBR) of the virtual disk


##### Shell script
